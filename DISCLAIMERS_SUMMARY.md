## User Consent Implementation

### Interactive Consent Prompt (`analyze_with_ai.py`)

Before submitting any data to Azure OpenAI, users see:

```
===============================================================================
⚠️  AI DATA SUBMISSION & PRIVACY CONSENT
===============================================================================

This script will send sanitized PCAP analysis data to Azure OpenAI for AI analysis.

BEFORE PROCEEDING, CONFIRM:
  ✓ You have verified the PCAP data is properly sanitized
  ✓ You have authorization to submit data to Azure OpenAI services
  ✓ You understand data will be processed by Microsoft Azure OpenAI
  ✓ You have reviewed your organization's data sharing policies
  ✓ You accept this is a non-production troubleshooting tool

See full disclaimer at the top of this script for details.

Do you consent to submit data to Azure OpenAI for analysis? (yes/no): _
```

**User must type "yes" to proceed. Script exits otherwise.**

## Communicating to Customers

### High-Level Summary (for external customers):

> "I performed a high-level, pattern-based review of sanitized packet capture samples using experimental troubleshooting tools. This was not a production-grade forensic analysis. The findings represent observed patterns and correlations that require validation in your environment through the provided verification guides."

### Technical Note (for internal/technical audience):

> "Analysis performed using non-production PCAP sanitization and AI analysis tools. Data was anonymized and analyzed for patterns consistent with network issues. This is exploratory analysis based on packet-level observations. Verification steps provided for customer's environment testing."

### Key Points to Emphasize:

1. **High-level pattern analysis** - Not packet-by-packet forensics
2. **Sanitized/anonymized data** - Privacy-conscious approach
3. **Non-production tools** - Experimental troubleshooting aids
4. **Patterns and correlations** - Observations requiring validation
5. **Verification required** - Customer must validate in their environment

## Questions & Answers

### Q: Can I use these tools with production data?
**A:** Not recommended. These are experimental tools for testing and development. If you must analyze production data:
1. Sanitize it first using `sanitize_pcap.py`
2. Manually review the sanitized output
3. Obtain proper approvals
4. Do NOT submit to AI without explicit authorization

### Q: Are these tools GDPR/HIPAA/PCI-DSS compliant?
**A:** No. These tools are experimental and not certified for compliance. They can assist with sanitization as part of a larger compliance workflow, but should not be relied upon as sole compliance solutions.

### Q: What if I accidentally submit sensitive data?
**A:** 
1. Do NOT proceed with the analysis
2. Follow your organization's data incident response procedures
3. Review Azure OpenAI data retention policies
4. Document the incident per your organization's requirements

### Q: Can I modify these tools for production use?
**A:** Yes, the code is available under MIT license. However:
- You assume all responsibility for modifications
- You must perform thorough security and compliance testing
- You should engage proper security review processes
- Consider engaging professional security auditors
