## Release Notes

### Version 1.0.0

This is the initial public release of PCAP AI Analyzer, a tool born from real-world Azure AKS troubleshooting scenarios. 

**Key Highlights:**
- Reduces 500MB PCAP files to actionable insights for ~$0.001-$0.01 (gpt-5-chat)
- Identifies root causes that would take hours of manual analysis
- Production-tested on Azure Kubernetes Service network captures
- Fully sanitized for sharing with vendors and support teams

**Use Cases:**
- DevOps incident response
- Network troubleshooting automation
- Security forensics (with PII protection)
- Azure/AKS escalation support

**Tested With:**
- Azure OpenAI GPT-5 series models
- PCAP files ranging from 100MB to 1GB
- Various network protocols (TCP, UDP, DNS, HTTP, TLS)
- AKS cluster captures with 200K+ packets
